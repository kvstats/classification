# Prediction of Debt Crisis Events
Inspired by Manassee-Roubini (2009), the purpose of this analysis is to investigate the set of economic and political conditions that are associated with a likely occurrence of a debt crisis. 

As a classification exercise, we will examine the following classifiers:
- Penalized Logistic Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest classifier
- Boosting tree classifier
- K-NN classifier with K=5

In order to tune the model's parameters and find the accuracy of my model, we will be using a k-fold cross-validation procedure for hyperparameter tuning and examining AUC scores as a measure of accuracy.
